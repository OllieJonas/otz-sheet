# Otz Killer & Survivor Info Front-End

Front-end for a website containing information for Otzdarva's Killer & Survivor Info spreadsheet (not including Builds) using Handlebars.

This project is heavily inspired by MrTipson's implementation for the Builds portion of the sheet (see [Here](https://github.com/MrTipson/otz-builds)).

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages, and can be found [Here](https://olliejonas.github.io/otz-sheet/dist).

Data is collected & collated from a separate project, which can be found [Here](https://github.com/OllieJonas/scrape-dbd-perks).
